# Jengax - Click to Sketch!
A simple sketching tool inspired by Townscaper and Jenga. Sketch one click at a time.

**Jengax** is a browser-based interactive block-stacking sketch tool inspired by construction logic puzzles.  
Users can place vertical and horizontal rectangular pieces based on specific support rules.

- Keep mouse pressed and pieces will keep falling randomly, as [here](https://imgur.com/a/JPchOSL)
